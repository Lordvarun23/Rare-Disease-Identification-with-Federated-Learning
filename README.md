# Rare-Disease-Identification-with-Federated-Learning

### Abstract:
Rare diseases present a unique challenge in modern healthcare, with diagnosis and treatment often hampered by limited data and expertise at individual hospitals. This paper introduces an approach using federated learning to bridge this gap while preserving patient privacy. We propose a federated learning framework in which each hospital independently learns from clinical notes using autoencoders to identify anomaly. The novel aspect of our approach lies in the simultaneous monitoring of embeddings for similarity, all while preserving the privacy of individual patients. Our solution not only streamlines the identification of rare diseases but also upholds the principles of data privacy. By harnessing the power of federated learning and the latent space, we create a collaborative ecosystem that enhances the diagnostic and treatment capabilities of healthcare institutions.
